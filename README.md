This is a simple framework that I created around 7 months or so ago.
It was in response to a pretty bloated framework using inline-blocks
instead of floats that I was stuck code reviewing
for an employee that worked at a company I contracted for.  I had orginally
created this as just a percentage-based framework but added inline-blocks
rather than floats for testing purposes. Rather than toss it in the garage
I figured that someone out there liked using inline-blocks for positioning
more than I did and might want to fork it and add or rearrange some things.
